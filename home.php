<p> Academia aims at providing a better experience to the students to access the academic web services of the Faculty of Engineering & Technology, SRM University. This will be a gateway for your academic information and offer services like Updating your contact info, Course registration, access to your attendance and internals, some administrative request forms and other e-services rolled out time to time. We would also enable an internal social network through this platform and make it a more utility based lively platform for the students. We are open to suggestions for improvement and appreciate supportive efforts to create a digitally enabled paper free campus.
         As a first step, fill in the student update form to keep us well connected to you.
       Once you complete the student update form you will receive further details on the course registration.
